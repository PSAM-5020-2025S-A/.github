## Course Description

This is a 14-week course meant to introduce students to the wild and wonderful world of data analysis and machine learning from critical, practical and creative perspectives. Through readings, projects and programming assignments, students will develop a solid understanding of Machine Learning applications and techniques related to media processing, analysis and creation. We will use Python and Jupyter notebooks to run, fine-tune and analyze existing machine learning models.

## Prerequisites

## Course Objectives

By the end of the course, students will have:

- Experience with the Python language and libraries for working with data (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn).
- Knowledge of data structures and algorithms used for analyzing and processing different types of media.
- Basic understanding of neural networks and how they are trained and evaluated.
- Practical experience with the PyTorch framework for developing computer vision and natural language models.
- Ability to pick appropriate methods, models and datasets for creating their own machine learning systems.
- Critically engaged with the process of creating ML models and its social, economical and political effects.
