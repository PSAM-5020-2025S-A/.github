## Course Description

This is a 14-week course meant to introduce students to the wild and wonderful world of data analysis and machine learning from critical, practical and creative perspectives. Machine learning is the systematic study of algorithms and systems that improve their knowledge and performance with experience. Collecting and analyzing data through machine learning algorithms and models can uncover complex patterns in massive amounts of data to make more accurate predictions and reveal coherent relationships. The course covers classification, regression and clustering models using classic Machine Learning techniques as well as a brief intro to neural networks and deep learning methods. Special attention will be given to models and techniques that aid and support the visualization of complex data. 

Through readings, projects and programming assignments, students will develop a solid understanding of Machine Learning applications and techniques related to media processing, analysis and creation. We will use Python and Jupyter notebooks to run, fine-tune and analyze existing machine learning models.

## Prerequisites

An introductory course in probability and statistics ([NURP 5013](https://courses.newschool.edu/courses/NURP5013/), [GPSY6133](https://courses.newschool.edu/courses/GPSY6133/) or similar) or linear algebra ([GECO5010](https://courses.newschool.edu/courses/GECO5010/) or similar) and intermediate experience with a programming language such as JavaScript, Python or R is necessary to guarantee meaningful engagement in the course.


## Course Objectives

By the end of the course, students will have:

- Experience with the Python language and libraries for working with data (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch).
- Knowledge of data structures and algorithms used for analyzing and processing different types of media.
- An understanding of a broad set of classification, regression, and clustering methodologies and when they should be used.
- An intuitive understanding of the mathematical models for machine learning.
- Basic understanding of neural networks and how they are trained and evaluated.
- Ability to pick appropriate methods, models and datasets for creating their own machine learning systems.
- Critically engaged with the process of creating ML models and its social, economical and political effects.

## Course Organization

### Programming Assignments

Weekly exercises to experiment with the Python language and libraries for working with data.

### Reading Assignments

Readings from books about the social implications of machine learning and big data systems.

### Project

Around week 08 we will start working on a longer project that will combine many of the topics covered in the class like: data collection and processing, model selection, training and evaluation.

The project will be broken up into milestones for different aspects of its development.

### Participation

After each class, students will submit a short reaction text via Canvas, detailing any questions, or summarizing what they learned in the class. These are always due on the day after class.

## Grading

The grade for this course will be determined according to the following:

| Activity | % of Final Grade |
| --- | --- |
| Programming Assignments | 50% |
| Participation | 5% |
| Reading Responses | 15% |
| Final Project | 30% |

Letter grades for the entire course will be assigned as follows:

| Letter Grade | Points | Overall Percent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | 4.00 | 90% - 100% |
| B+ | 3.33 | 85% - 89.99% |
| B | 3.00 | 80% - 84.99% |
| C+ | 2.33 | 75% - 79.99% |
| C | 2.00 | 70% - 74.99% |
| F | 0.00 | 0% - 69.99% |

## Required Materials

- A GitHub account.
- A notebook (digital or physical) for sketching ideas that can be included in write-ups.
- A Laptop

## Optional

- A text editor suitable for writing code, like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Textbooks

All of these will be available digitally:

XXX BOOKS XXX

Additional reading materials will be distributed throughout the semester.

## Resources

The university provides many resources to help students achieve academic and artistic excellence. These resources include:
- [The University (and associated) Libraries](https://library.newschool.edu/)
- [The University Learning Center](https://www.newschool.edu/learning-center/)
- [University Disabilities Service](https://www.newschool.edu/student-disability-services/)

In keeping with the universityâ€™s policy of providing equal access for students with disabilities, any student with a disability who needs academic accommodations is welcome to meet with me privately. All conversations will be kept confidential. Students requesting any accommodations will also need to contact Student Disability Service (SDS). SDS will conduct an intake and, if appropriate, the Director will provide an academic accommodation notification letter for you to bring to me. At that point, I will review the letter with you and discuss these accommodations in relation to this course.
