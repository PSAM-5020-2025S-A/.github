## Course Description

This is a 14-week course meant to introduce students to the wild and wonderful world of data analysis and machine learning from critical, practical and creative perspectives. Machine learning is the systematic study of algorithms and systems that improve their knowledge and performance with experience. Collecting and analyzing data through machine learning algorithms and models can uncover complex patterns in massive amounts of data to make more accurate predictions and reveal coherent relationships. The course covers classification, regression and clustering models using classic Machine Learning techniques as well as a brief intro to neural networks and deep learning methods. Special attention will be given to models and techniques that aid and support the visualization of complex data. 

Through readings, projects and programming assignments, students will develop a solid understanding of Machine Learning applications and techniques related to media processing, analysis and creation. We will use Python and Jupyter notebooks to run, fine-tune and analyze existing machine learning models.

## Prerequisites

An introductory course in probability and statistics ([NURP 5013](https://courses.newschool.edu/courses/NURP5013/), [GPSY6133](https://courses.newschool.edu/courses/GPSY6133/) or similar) or linear algebra ([GECO5010](https://courses.newschool.edu/courses/GECO5010/) or similar) and intermediate experience with a programming language such as JavaScript, Python or R is necessary to guarantee meaningful engagement in the course.


## Course Objectives

By the end of the course, students will have:

- Experience with the Python language and libraries for working with data (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch).
- Knowledge of data structures and algorithms used for analyzing and processing different types of media.
- An understanding of a broad set of classification, regression, and clustering methodologies and when they should be used.
- An intuitive understanding of the mathematical models for machine learning.
- Basic understanding of neural networks and how they are trained and evaluated.
- Ability to pick appropriate methods, models and datasets for creating their own machine learning systems.
- Critically engaged with the process of creating ML models and its social, economical and political effects.

## Course Organization

### Programming Assignments

Weekly exercises to experiment with the Python language and libraries for working with data.

### Reading Assignments

Readings from books about the social implications of machine learning and big data systems.

### Project

Around week 08 we will start working on a longer project that will combine many of the topics covered in the class like: data collection and processing, model selection, training and evaluation.

The project will be broken up into milestones for different aspects of its development.

### Participation

After each class, students will submit a short reaction text via Canvas, detailing any questions, or summarizing what they learned in the class. These are always due on the day after class.

### Expectation for Work Outside the Classroom

Students should expect to spend roughly 6 hours each week on supplemental work in this course. This may include reading assignments, programming assignments, writing assignments, research, etc.

## Grading

The grade for this course will be determined according to the following:

| Activity | % of Final Grade |
| --- | --- |
| Programming Assignments | 50% |
| Participation | 5% |
| Reading Responses | 15% |
| Final Project | 30% |

Letter grades for the entire course will be assigned as follows:

| Letter Grade | Points | Overall Percent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | 4.00 | 90% - 100% |
| B+ | 3.33 | 85% - 89.99% |
| B | 3.00 | 80% - 84.99% |
| C+ | 2.33 | 75% - 79.99% |
| C | 2.00 | 70% - 74.99% |
| F | 0.00 | 0% - 69.99% |

Grade of W
The grade of W may be issued by the Office of the Registrar to a student who officially withdraws from a course within the applicable deadline. There is no academic penalty, but the grade will appear on the student transcript.

Grade of Z
The grade of Z is issued by an instructor to a student who has not attended or not completed all required work in a course but did not officially withdraw before the withdrawal deadline. It differs from an “F,” which would indicate that the student technically completed requirements but that the level of work did not qualify for a passing grade.

## Course Policies

### Responsibility
Students are responsible for all assignments, even if they are absent. Late assignments, failure to complete assignments, lack of preparedness for in-class discussions or presentations will jeopardize your successful completion of this course.

### Participation
Class participation is an essential part of class and includes: keeping up with reading, assignments, projects, contributing meaningfully to class discussions and coming to class regularly and on time. Participation notes will be a part of the grade and must be submitted via Canvas every week after lecture.

### Attendance
Parsons’ attendance guidelines were developed to encourage students’ success in all aspects of their academic programs. Full participation is essential to the successful completion of coursework and enhances the quality of the educational experience for all, particularly in courses where group work is integral; thus, Parsons promotes high levels of attendance. Students are expected to attend classes regularly and promptly.

While attendance is just one aspect of active participation, absence from a significant portion of class time may prevent the successful attainment of course objectives. A significant portion of class time is here defined as the equivalent of three weeks, or 20%, of class time. Students may be asked to withdraw from a course if habitual absenteeism or tardiness has a negative impact on the class environment.

### Canvas
Use of Canvas will be an important resource for this class. Students should check it for announcements, readings, assignments and lecture notes before and after class.

### Delays
In rare instances, the instructor may be delayed arriving to class. If the instructor has not arrived by the time class is scheduled to start, you must wait a minimum of thirty minutes. In the event that the instructor will miss class entirely, an email will be sent indicating your assignment for the next class meeting.

### Electronic Devices
The use of electronic devices (phones, tablets, laptops, cameras, etc.) is permitted when the device is being used in relation to the course's work. All other uses are prohibited in the classroom and devices should be turned off before class starts.

### Academic Honesty and Integrity
Compromising your academic integrity may lead to serious consequences, including (but not limited to) one or more of the following: failure of the assignment, failure of the course, academic warning, disciplinary probation, suspension from the university, or dismissal from the university.

Students are responsible for understanding the University’s policy on academic honesty and integrity and must make use of proper citations of sources for writing papers, creating, presenting, and performing their work, taking examinations, and doing research. It is the responsibility of students to learn the procedures specific to their discipline for correctly and appropriately differentiating their own work from that of others. The full text of the policy, including adjudication procedures, is found at
[http://www.newschool.edu/policies/](http://www.newschool.edu/policies/). Resources regarding what plagiarism is and how to avoid it can be found on the [Learning Center website](http://www.newschool.edu/university-learning-center/student-resources/).

The New School views "academic honesty and integrity" as the duty of every member of an academic community to claim authorship for his or her own work and only for that work, and to recognize the contributions of others accurately and completely. This obligation is fundamental to the integrity of intellectual debate, and creative and academic pursuits. Academic honesty and integrity includes accurate use of quotations, as well as appropriate and explicit citation of sources in instances of paraphrasing and describing ideas, or reporting on research findings or any aspect of the work of others (including that of faculty members and other students). Academic dishonesty results from infractions of this "accurate use". The standards of academic honesty and integrity, and citation of sources, apply to all forms of academic work, including submissions of drafts of final papers or projects. All members of the University community are expected to conduct themselves in accord with the standards of academic honesty and integrity. Please see the complete policy in the Parsons Catalog.

All work for this class must be your own and specific to this semester. Any work recycled from other classes or from another, non-original source will be rejected with serious implications for the student. Plagiarism, knowingly representing the words or ideas of another as one’s own work in any academic exercise, is absolutely unacceptable. Any student who commits plagiarism must re-do the assignment for a penalized grade.

If there are questions about a specific situation, please ask.

### Social Etiquette

These [Social Rules from The Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/social-rules) should be kept in mind during class discussions, presentations, critiques:
- [No well-actually’s](https://www.recurse.com/social-rules#no-well-actuallys)
- [No feigned surprise](https://www.recurse.com/social-rules#no-feigning-surprise)
- [No backseat driving](https://www.recurse.com/social-rules#no-backseat-driving)
- [No subtle -isms](https://www.recurse.com/social-rules#no-subtle-isms)

Also, these observations from a [discussion about ethics in tech](https://www.crummy.com/2013/11/27/0) are a helpful reminder:

*"There is a general rule for comedy and art: always punch up, never punch down. We let comedians and artists and miscellaneous jesters do outrageous things as long as they obey this rule. You can poke fun at yourself, you can make a joke at the expense of someone with higher social status than you, otherwise, it's not cool."*

*"If you make a joke, and people get really offended, it's almost certainly because you violated this rule. People don't get offended randomly. Explaining that 'it was just a joke' doesn't help; everyone knows what a joke is. The problem is that you used a joke as a means of being an asshole."*

Be sensitive to what your classmates might find offensive, triggering or violent and be graceful and listen carefully when your work gets called out for being offensive, triggering or violent.

### A Special Note on Open Source and "Found Code"

There's an amount of sharing and re-using that will happen in this course due to the open source nature of the libraries, tools and learning materials we will be using. Plus a lot of assignments will be turned in using github, a platform for sharing code and other content.

Nonetheless, we have to be careful and conscious about the difference between using available tools that help us with our learning experience, and submitting other people's work as our own. It's not hard to find code online that will do things similar to, or exactly alike, the things you will be developing for this class. It is NOT ok to use those as part of an assignment or project for this class.

On the other hand, it's also not hard to find code/libraries/packages/examples that solve specific technical tasks that are part of a larger project or assignment. For example: a library that converts gifs into movies or code for working with different text encodings. These are specific tasks that we aren't going to solve on our own, so using an open source solution is acceptable and expected.

You are expected to cite any tutorials, examples, libraries or inspiration that you use for our work. Sometimes the authors have a specific way they'd like their work cited (CC licenses), otherwise a name and a link is fine.

TL;DR: Copying assignment code from other sources, using any code from other sources with only slight modifications or using any code from other sources without a reference is plagiarism.

If there are questions about a specific situation, please ask.

### A Special Note on LLMs and Large Diffusion Models

This is a class about creative uses of technology, and LLMs and interfaces like ChatGPT, Midjourney, etc definitely have their place in discussions about technology, society and creativity. Being in the environment we are in, it has become impossible to ignore these tools.

Having said that....

You may use AI interfaces to help generate ideas and images as it pertains to the brainstorming or ideation portions of a project and/or to generate images for presentations, as long as proper credit is given.

This won't be helpful until the final project, but these tools may be used sparingly to generate code as long as proper credit is given and you understand the code it generated. For homeworks and class exercises, it will be easier to read, understand and adapt code that is shown in lectures and other class materials. The instructor cannot debug, fix or give advice on code generated by LLMs.

You may NOT submit any work generated by these interfaces as your own.

Again, if there are any questions about a specific situation, just ask.

General information about Student Disability Services can be found at [https://www.newschool.edu/student-disability-services/](https://www.newschool.edu/student-disability-services/). Student Disability Services is located on 63 Fifth Avenue, room 425.

## Statement of Equity, Inclusion and Social Justice

As students, artists, designers, educators, and cultural producers, we must acknowledge the lineages of white supremacy, racial discrimination, and other forms of systemic oppression that exist within our society in the U.S. and abroad. In the School of Art, Media & Technology (AMT), we are committed to creating a more inclusive, equitable and anti-racist community. We aim to support and advocate for the needs of all AMT students, staff and faculty across all identities of race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, religion, culture, citizenship, or socio-economic status. We will stand in solidarity with marginalized communities who have been historically excluded from institutions, including Black, Indigenous, Latinx, AAPI (Asian, Asian American and Pacific Islander), People of Color, Queer, and Trans folks, and aim to center their narratives and practices within our learning environment. We recognize the limitations of language that can’t envelop the breadth of all intersectional identities, and as such, we are committed to advancing equity, respect, and thoughtfulness within our teaching pedagogy, curriculum, classrooms and across AMT.
